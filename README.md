# house_price_prediction_ApacheSpark

   * I use apache spark for this implementation . for that i use DataBricks Community Edition . In DataBricks community edition we can't intergrate with Git because of that i couldn't use version control thats why i push all the code base at once .

   * When implement the model i use convert all the categorical features into numerical and create input vector using all features . linear regression use for training model
